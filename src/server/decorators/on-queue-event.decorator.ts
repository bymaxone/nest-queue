/**
 * Marks a method as a global queue-event listener. The method is bound to a
 * lazily-created `QueueEvents` instance via `queueEvents.on(event, fn)` at
 * discovery time. A single `QueueEvents` connection is shared across all
 * `@OnQueueEvent` listeners for the same queue.
 *
 * The handler receives a **serialized** payload, e.g.:
 * - `completed` — `{ jobId: string, returnvalue: string, prev?: string }`
 * - `failed`    — `{ jobId: string, failedReason: string, prev?: string }`
 * - `active`    — `{ jobId: string, prev?: string }`
 * - `progress`  — `{ jobId: string, data: number | object }`
 * - `waiting`   — `{ jobId: string }`
 *
 * `error` is the exception to that rule: it carries a real `Error` instance, not
 * a serialized payload, because it reports a fault on the connection rather than
 * a transition of any single job — so there is no `jobId` to look up. The library
 * registers its own listener for it, which logs and keeps an unlistened emission
 * from throwing; a handler declared here runs in addition to that one.
 *
 * To retrieve the full job, call `QueueService.getJob(payload.jobId)`, which
 * may return `null` if the job was already evicted by `removeOnComplete`.
 *
 * Multiple `@OnQueueEvent` decorators on the same class accumulate without
 * overwriting each other.
 *
 * @param eventName - The queue event to listen for.
 *
 * @example
 * `@OnQueueEvent`('completed')
 * async onCompleted({ jobId, returnvalue }: { jobId: string; returnvalue: string }) {
 *   this.logger.log(`Job ${jobId} finished with result ${returnvalue}`)
 * }
